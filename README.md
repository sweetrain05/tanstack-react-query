# tanstack-react-query
### üì£ About this webpage
- In this project, I made an event bulletin board using **tanstack-react-query**:
- As a user, you can: 
  - See the board which will show 3 most recently added events.
  - Search for a specific event with a keyword.
  - Create a new event with title, image, date&time, venue, and description.
  - Delete the existing event which will be confirmed with a confirmation modal.
  - Edit the event.
- As a developer, I learned how to use:
  - useQuery, queryKey, queryFn
  - Show various http request status using isPending, isLoading, isError, error
  - useMutation, mutationFn, onSuccess, onMutate, onError, onSettled
  - queryClient
